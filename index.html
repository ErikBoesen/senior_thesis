            <h1>Ripplify: Music Taste Visualization for Nostalgia & Joy</h1>
            <p><em>CPSC 490 Senior Project by <a href="https://erikboesen.com">Erik Boesen</a>. Advised by Stephen Slade.</em></p>

            <h2>Abstract:</h2>
            <p>I have built a sophisticated data visualization platform that enables users to examine their Spotify music listening history through beautiful stream graphs. There are many existing websites that simply query Spotify's API and stylize the provided list of a listener's top artists and songs. For dedicated users, Spotify’s data disclosure policy allows downloading a large history file containing far more extensive records of all the music listening that has ever occurred on an account. For each song listen ever performed by a user, this archive presents granular information about when listening was stopped and started down to the millisecond, how the user started and stopped playback (clicking directly on a song, pressing skip/back, shuffling a playlist, etc.). As acquiring listening history dumps is moderately more difficult and time consuming than granting OAuth access to use the Spotify API, there are fewer tools available online to visualize these datasets, rich in information and insights though they are. I present a highly refined and visually pleasing graphing tool that enables users to see the entire story of their music taste’s evolution over time at a glance, enabling individuals to reflect on how their tastes and engagements with music have shifted during their lives, and aiming to instinctively convey a portrait of how an individual’s life has intertwined with their favorite artists. This project was built using React on the front end; Python, Flask, PlanetScale DB, and AWS Lambda for the backend; and JavaScript/D3 and Lambda for an independent rendering microservice. Integrating these components involved overcoming a number of implementation challenges, and the completed website implementation can be found at <a href="https://ripplify.io">ripplify.io</a>.</p>
